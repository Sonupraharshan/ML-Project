# Literature Survey

## 1. Satellite-Based AQI Estimation
-   **Gupta et al. (2006)**: Demonstrated strong correlation between MODIS AOD and ground PM2.5.
-   **Van Donkelaar et al. (2016)**: Global estimates of PM2.5 using satellite data, highlighting gaps in developing nations.

## 2. Transfer Learning in Remote Sensing
-   **Ganin et al. (2016)**: Introduced Domain-Adversarial Training of Neural Networks (DANN), enabling effective domain adaptation without target labels.
-   **Wang et al. (2018)**: Applied Deep Domain Adaptation for hyperspectral image classification.

## 3. Rural Air Quality
-   Studies highlight that rural air quality is often ignored but significantly impacted by agricultural burning and household biomass usage. Traditional monitoring networks are sparse, making satellite-based approaches critical.

## 4. Gap Analysis
-   Most existing Indian studies focus on Delhi/Mumbai.
-   Lack of granular, village-level estimations.
-   Limited use of advanced domain adaptation to bridge the urban-rural monitoring gap.
